# NewFilm

## Description
This is a full stack website made using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). At the moment only the homepage is completed, but I will be updating pages as time goes on. The styles for this project are made using [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). I wanted to do a project where I made my own movie website with inspiration from Netflix and imdb. I used a components and svgs from [Shape Divider](https://www.shapedivider.app/) and [Aceternity](https://ui.aceternity.com/) to give the website a more modern feel. I hope you enjoy my work so far!

### API
The api at the moment is primarily for fetching data from the [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) api and I put the code in the api to fetch instead of the client to prevent api keys being exposed on the client. All movie data is acquired through the TMDB api.
